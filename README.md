# Teddy-Bear-Site
I started learning HTML and got me to make this trial project.
It contains numerous things such as-
01. It contains headings with different sizes and marks.
02. It contains a Tabular form of Teddy's description, I added some unusual descriptions that are kinda funny to me at the time.
03. It contains Tables and Lists that contain details of Teddy and more.
04. It contains some pictures one of which is Teddy's and the others are to make the site FULL. I'll be adding CSS for it later.
05. It contains a form that you can fill and submit, it will not save the details though as I have not connected it to the backend.
06. It will contain some more details as I add them moving forward and I will mention them as they get added.
-I know it's child's play compared to everything on this platform, but I am very proud of my accomplishments and just wanted to show them.

# Languages:
# HTML
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page.
# CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
